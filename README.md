Valence is a modern, fast, lightweight and feature rich code editor built with Electron and React.

## Why:thinking: ?

Let's admit it, [Atom](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/) was great and I was one of the many Atom enthusiasts who wanted to continue the development of the
project. There are many forks of Atom out there like [Pulsar Edit](https://pulsar-edit.dev) that use the strong foundation of Atom. But I wanted to do something different,
I wanted to start from scratch. And that's how Project Valence was born. It is currently a sideproject being developed by [me](https://github.com/anantnrg)
, a high school student.
